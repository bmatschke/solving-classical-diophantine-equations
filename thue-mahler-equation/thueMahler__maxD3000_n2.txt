# List of all primitive integral solutions of the Thue-Mahler equations
# f(x,y) = z, where
# f is any reduced binary cubic with non-zero discriminant bounded by |D(f)| <= 3000,
# such that only primes dividing z are among S, where
# S is the set of the first 2 primes.
# Note that some GL_2(Z)-equivalence classes of forms may have several reduced representatives.
# It contains 33456 pairs in total.
# Format: "(x,y)".
