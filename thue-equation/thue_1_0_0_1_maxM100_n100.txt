# List of pairs of S-integers (x,y) satisfying
# 1x^3 + 0x^2y + 0xy^2 + 1y^3 = m, where
# m = 1, ..., 100 and
# S is the set of the first 100 primes.
# For each solution (x,y), only one of (x,y), (y,x) is listed.
# It contains 140 pairs in total.
# Format: "(x,y)".
# Computing this list took 3544 seconds.
