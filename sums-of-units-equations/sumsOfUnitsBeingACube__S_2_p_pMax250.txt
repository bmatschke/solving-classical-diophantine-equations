# List of all pairs of integers (x,y) such that
# x + y is a cube, gcd(x,y) is cube-free, x >= y, |x| >= |y|, and the only primes dividing x and y lie in S,
# for all sets S = {2, p},
# where p ranges over all other primes less or equal to 250.
# It contains 372 pairs (x,y), some of which may appear for more than one S.
# Format: "(x,y)".
# Computing this list took 976 seconds.
