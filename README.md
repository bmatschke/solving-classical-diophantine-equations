# Solving Classical Diophantine Equations

### Contents

Source code and data for various diophantine problems:

 - S-unit equations
 - Mordell equations over S-integers
 - cubic Thue and Thue-Mahler equations
 - generalized Ramanujan-Nagell equations
 - sums of units equations
 - computing S-integral points on rational elliptic curves
 - database of rational elliptic curves with given places of bad reduction
 - Mordell-Weil bases

The source code is written in [sage](https://www.sagemath.org/):

 - s-unit.sage
 - mordell.sage

The data is accessible from the [data page](https://bmatschke.github.io/solving-classical-diophantine-equations/) and can be found alternatively in the folders of [this repository](https://github.com/bmatschke/solving-classical-diophantine-equations).
